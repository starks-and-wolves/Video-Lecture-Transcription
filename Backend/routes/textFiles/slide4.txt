Why not directly check root over of A? It may likely happen that if you go in the reverse way of the for loop, then you will encounter the number that divides A very quickly. Okay. So now instead of going from two to root over of A, we'll start from root over of A and then try to come to in between. If any number divides A, then you exist. That's not a problem. So this is the adventure systematic development for ad hoc.

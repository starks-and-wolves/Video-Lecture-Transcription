Software in an application and you can't have an ad hoc development. What is ad hoc names like say for example from the C programming understanding. I'll give same DCV example. Okay. So on the prime number calculation of the prime number. So what do you know by the calculation of Pride number? If I ask you that, write a program to find out to check whether a number or given new numbers within that. How many prime numbers are there? If A and B are given, then find out all the prime numbers between A and B. What you will do, we will take A. You know that prime numbers are divisible only by itself and one. So if you are picking up A, then we'll start from two to a minus one and see if any number in between divides A in that case, if not, then it's price.

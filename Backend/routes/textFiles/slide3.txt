 Okay. If you divide by two, then also it is taking a considerable amount of computation. Can I further reduce it? Then we will try to find out and know that if you take a square root of eight of the number, suppose the number is A. Then square root of A. That means you have to start from two to the square root of A. Okay. There you will find that your number of computations is drastically reduced above square root of A will not divide A. Okay. This is the mathematical probation for that. And then if you have been planning and habituated in planning, you'd realize that why do I need to start from two to root over of A?

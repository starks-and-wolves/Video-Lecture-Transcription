So you have this understanding of directly. But what is the systematic plan way of writing the code or development is that you know that time numbers, any number that is greater than the middle number will not be able to divide the number. Let's say eight. So any number eight by four is four. So any number that is greater than four and less than eight will not divide the eight the number eight. Okay. So you will now not check for five, six, seven. You will stop at four. Okay. So that will drastically reduce your computation, isn't it? Then now you will realize I'm talking about systematic planning. Now then you will realize that what if the number is not small number like eight. It's a very huge number, let's say six, seven digit number.
